Data Quality Dimensions (Dirty)
Dirty data = low quality data = content issues
1. Completeness - missing data
2. Validity - e.g -6 inches tall, duplicate ids(which should be unique), (integers as floats - zip code)
3. Accuracy - Inaccurate data can be valid such as a faulty scale
4. Consistency - Inconsistent data can be valid and accurate e.g. (male and m)


Data Tidiness Dimensions (Messy)
Messy data = untidy data = structural issues
Deals with the structure of the table rather than the quality of the data
1. Each variable forms a colum e.g having email and address in same column
2. Each observation forms a row 
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Tidy data makes it easy for an analyst or a computer to extract needed variables because it provides a standard way of structuring a dataset. 

most common problems with messy datasets
Column headers are values, not variable names.

Multiple variables are stored in one column.

Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.
